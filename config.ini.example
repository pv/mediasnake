# Copy this file to "config.ini" and customize it.

# video_dirs
# ----------
#
# One or more directories to look for videos, separated by commas.

# url_prefix
# ----------
#
# The location on your website under which this application is served
#

# data_dir
# --------
#
# Directory the application uses for storing all its data
#

# debug
# -----
#
# Whether to run the web application with debug enabled.  Enabling
# this on public web sites is insecure, but you can use it for
# development etc.

# secret_key
# ----------
#
# A secret key used for crypto of cookies. Just put some garbage in
# here.

# hostnames
# ---------
#
# One or more host names that this server should serve to, if you have
# several virtual hosts
#

# file_serving
# ------------
#
# The method used for e.g. streaming video files.
#
# - 'default': stream the file as usual from the web application.
#
# - 'nginx': allow the NGINX web server to serve the file directly.
#   For this to work, you need to make sure the NGINX server process
#   can read the video files, and to add the following to your NGINX
#   configuration::
#
#       location /<same-url-prefix-as-in-this-file>/streaming/ {
#           internal;
#           alias /path/to/mediasnake/data/streaming/;
#       }
#
# Allowing the web server to serve the files directly reduces the load
# on the web application.
#
file_serving = default


# http_streaming_address
# ----------------------
#
# When specified, the streaming URLs are always over HTTP.
#
# This option is useful only if you are hosting the app on HTTPS, but
# would like to stream the videos on HTTP.
#
# One motivation to do this could be that you are using a self-signed
# SSL certificate, and it is causing problems for applications you'd
# like to play the streams with.
#
# Only video stream data is transmitted over HTTP in this
# mode. Moreover, the streaming tickets do not contain information
# about the original file name, apart from the file type.
#
# The streaming tickets can only be used for watching a specific
# video, are locked to your IP address, and time out after a couple of
# hours.
#
# Examples:
#
# # Default behavior
# http_streaming_address =
#
# # Different port
# http_streaming_address = http://mysite.com:1234/
#
http_streaming_address =


# Database settings

#     One of: sqlite3, postgresql, mysql, oracle
