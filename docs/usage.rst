Mediasnake is a simple web application.

The main page displays an accordion-style list of folders you have on
disk. When you click on one of them, it expands to a thumbnail list
showing all videos inside the folder.

Clicking on a video opens up a streaming view. If your browser can
play the video directly, you can play it there. If not, you can open
the direct link in a player application of your choice.


Android
-------

A simple way to stream videos to an Android tablet is:

- Install VLC Android media player.

- Browse to your Mediasnake server, and click "Stream" on a video of
  your liking.

- Unless your videos are in MP4 format, they don't play in the Android
  web browser directly.

  If so, do a long press on the "Direct link" button in Mediasnake's
  streaming view, and choose to open the file with VLC. Presto!
